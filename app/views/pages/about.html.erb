<h1>About Service Honoured</h1>

<p>Service Honoured provides a career commemoration to retired Canadian military service members by producing a very high quality, unique “scroll” indicating the member’s postings and deployments over their career.  As the scroll is custom produced to an individual’s career, and will use Canadian Forces heraldic badges, it will be a “one-stop-shop” summary of their career.  It will be done on heavy weight art paper with archival inks, creating an heirloom memento that can be treasured by family for centuries to come, if properly handled</p>

<p>To start, only military career commemorations will be produced, for any person who has served in the Canadian military.  It can be produced for a departed individual, if a family wishes to have a memento of that member.  Individual histories will need to be provided by the customer, and the correctness of the product will only be guaranteed for the correct association of badges to the submitted history.  As the customer is submitting the history, correctness of the information has to be borne by the customer.</p>

<p>Service Honoured will not provide research services for people looking to commemorate departed service members.  Access to military records is available through Library and Archives Canada.  Inherent in this issue is that personal records are protected, and proof of familial relationships is demanded for access to certain records.  Therefore, we are back to the customer providing the member history to produce a scroll.</p>

<p>The scrolls will be customizable to the service in which the person served, through the badge history, scroll content customization (“High Flight” for pilots, the “Technician’s Creed” for technicians, “In Appreciation” for support and clerical staff, “Serving Canada” as a more generic universal element, and others that have been created over the years.  In addition, watermarks of vehicles, places or people can be used for heightened personalization, and the border trim can be tailored for future matting consideration.</p>

<p>Framing is not being considered at this time due to problems shipping glass.  Matting and mounting is being considered, to provide some assurance that conservation materials would be used, but this again would be provided at a cost-recovery basis.  A local framing business has been contacted as a possible partner in matt production, should this be in high demand.</p>

<h2>The COO</h2>

<p>The Chief Operation Officer is a retired Royal Canadian Air Force Captain, with 37 years of service, over three elements and two services.  He has served with the Reserves as a Combat Engineer (army demolitions and construction), and with the Regular Force in the Navy as a Firecontrol Technician (Gunner), with the Air Force as an Avionics Technician and an Aerospace Engineering Officer (aircraft maintenance manager).  Over that time, he has been part of many historical military events as a participant or organizer of commemorative events.  The concept of the service history commemorative scroll was conceived to provide a departing gift for retiring members, when the Departure with Dignity program didn't exist, and these scrolls have been produced since 1994.  Over the intervening time, experience has been gained with commercial printing operations.  Particularly, the COO oversaw the production of the commemorative limited issue art print of Robert Bradford’s “Avro 504Ks at Camp Borden” for the Borden Military Museum during the 75th RCAF Anniversary celebrations.</p>
